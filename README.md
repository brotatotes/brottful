## Inspiration
Science shows that your eating and sleeping patterns can affect your mental wellness - such as your motivation, stress, and energy levels. However, keeping tabs on your wellness each day can be tasking. Sometimes, keeping up with a journal entry every day takes a lot of effort and dedication. This project was inspired by the lack of an easy way to track your personal mood and wellbeing without having to sit down and collect your thoughts. It’s a quick and easy way to collect data on yourself so that you can thoughtfully plan your wellness goals in various parts of your life using a data-driven approach.

## What it does
The homepage is a simple survey on your mood, stress, energy, and motivation levels. The Results page shows the data collected in graphs for weekly and monthly data points. It will also have AI-generated motivational quotes based on your data to inspire and encourage your wellness journey.

## How we built it
This was built using React, Express, and MongoDB.

## Challenges we ran into
It was challenging to craft and format questions in a way that supports uniform data collection as well as accurate insight into wellbeing. We looked up some social-work wellness worksheets and other journal articles to help us craft our survey questions.

## Accomplishments that we’re proud of
We’re proud of the user experience that we came up with. The survey is very succinct and supports our goal of being quick and easy to use. The data layout is also clean and summarizes the results of the survey well.

## What we learned
We learned a lot about app development, formatting, and collaboration.

## What’s next for brottful
We’d like to have another option to add more questions for if the user feels like they have the time and energy to do so. We didn’t want to the survey to be too long at first. We’d also like to do more research on other factors that impact wellness, so that we can include them in a longer survey - perhaps factors such as the weather, water intake, or time spent with friends and family.
